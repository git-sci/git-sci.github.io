## Survival Tips if you lose your job and you're panicking

- *Make sure you get paid out* any annual leave and anything you paid into the pension. Although, there is maybe the option to leave the pension funds there to keep your ‘service’ time in place in case you ever return to federal service. Weigh your options.
- *Apply for unemployment, food stamps, and Medicaid ASAP*. Food stamps too, if possible. *Don’t delay*; the approval process for unemployment and food stamps can be a hassle. Apply for SNAP the day you’re terminated. Every day counts towards those and many other benefits. That falls under Public Assistance/TANF.
- *Insurance*: If applicable, employees can opt to be added to spouse’s federal health plan, because loss of employment qualifies as a major life event and allows enrollment outside of Open Season. See [What to do if you are terminated](https://git-sci.github.io/) for more insurance information
- *Family/friend network:* Is there anyone in your life who can help you pay rent in an emergency? If your lease is up soon, is there someone you can move in with? Are there local rent assistance resources or charities in your area? See [Taking Care](https://git-sci.github.io/) — Mutual Aid
- *Do you have one vehicle or two*? If two, can you sell one? If one, can you sell it and rely on public transit?
- *Do you have expensive stuff you can sell* on FB Marketplace, eBay, or Poshmark to help ends meet? (A second TV, a fancy purse you never use, unused but nice clothes…)
- *Self care* and pleasure are important during times of stress and trauma, but are there any non-essentials you can cut to help make ends meet? Eating out, gym memberships, haircuts, nail appointments, expensive subscriptions… determine the difference between essentials and luxuries.
- *Contact your creditors* to find out if you are eligible for any forbearances or other special payment arrangements. Often, you can do this and stay in current-pay status on your credit report; ask your creditor / lender for details. This can help you decide how best to allocate any remaining regular income and stretch your cash reserves for a longer period of time.
- *Emergency retirement disbursements:* This is not a preferred option unless you have exhausted ALL others — Roth IRA contributions can be cashed out w/o penalty. 401k and Traditional IRA allow for small, untaxed emergency distributions.
- *Prior years of service?* If you have a built up TSP, consider a TSP[ in-service loan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.tsp.gov/tsp-loans/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1740078454759021%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1_yY9OgFWb3Y2l4xvCeY5c&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1740078454791461&usg=AOvVaw3GV7WacC1ENu7OVTzXzZQQ) against your TSP funds.  If you apply while you are still employed you get better terms and can carry those terms into unemployment. Interest is paid back to yourself.  This is **much** better than doing early withdrawals or living off of credit cards.
