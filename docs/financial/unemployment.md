If you are terminated, you may be eligible for unemployment.

If you plan to do so, apply ASAP. *Don’t delay*; the approval process for unemployment can be a hassle. Every day counts towards those and many other benefits. That falls under Public Assistance/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

*A tip from a fired fed:*

> First, let me again say to all of you to please take of yourselves. You are a hell lot more important than the jobs we lost. We are the Federal work force and we’ll get through this.
> So I am posting this to help out the many people looking for unemployment. Please note, I am in California. So when the VA Los Angeles canned me they did nothing for me and I’m still waiting for my last SF-50 not holding my breath.
> So to assist all of you (please check state) but here in California and in most states Federal employees can qualify for unemployment. Important!!!! When applying you should see a page (Please any upload documentation) I attached two things. My last SF-50 and my Termination letter. That’s all. I was scheduled for a quick call and the person that spoke to me said “smart move uploading the documents it saved you weeks of unemployment not being paid out.” So please pay attention to that screen. Again, I am in California.
