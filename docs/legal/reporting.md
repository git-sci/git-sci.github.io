# Whistleblowers

In broad terms, a whistleblower is an individual who discloses evidence of wrongdoing, regardless of whether subsequent retaliation occurs.

The legal definition in civil service law for a whistleblower is a*n employee, applicant, or former employee who discloses information that he or she reasonably believes evidences*:

- *A violation of law, rule, or regulation;*
- *Gross mismanagement;*
- *A gross waste of funds;*
- *Abuse of authority; or*
- *A substantial and sp*e*cific danger to public health or safety.*

Contrary to popular belief, an individual who discloses suspected wrongdoing does not need to experience retaliation to meet the legal definition of a whistleblower. Moreover, some individuals may better identify with the term "truth-teller" or "watchdog," for instance.

**Most whistleblowers simply perceive themselves as committed employees performing their jobs.**
