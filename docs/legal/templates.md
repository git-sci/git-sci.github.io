Archive any and all pertinent correspondence from supervisors and leadership, particularly regarding guidance related to DOGE directives, etc. Make sure this information is accessible to you if you were to lose access to your work systems.

## Email template: To supervisor if you were fired

(especially useful for those fired as probationary employees w/o other records)

[Supervisor], Today I received notice of termination (add details of how you were notified). Please respond to the following: Did you provide recommendation for my termination?

If so, please describe the instances of unsatisfactory performance, conduct, or conditions that arose before my appointment that led to your recommendation.

Regards, [Employee]

*Once your immediate supervisor responds negatively, forward that email with a copy of the same body as the original to the next supervisor in your chain. Repeat as high as you can go.*

## Email template: To official HR contact if you were fired

(especially useful for those fired as probationary employees w/o other records)

*[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Your Email] [Your Phone Number] [Date]*

*To: [Agency Official’s Name] [Agency Name] [Agency Address] [City, State, ZIP Code]*

*[OPM Representative’s Name] Office of Personnel Management [OPM Address] [City, State, ZIP Code]*

*Subject: Request for Justification and Compliance with Regulations Regarding Probationary Termination*

*Dear [Agency Official’s Name] and [OPM Representative’s Name],*

*I am writing in response to the termination notice I received, which states that my removal is due to “performance issues.” However, the notice does not provide specific explanations regarding my alleged deficiencies or reference any supporting documentation from my employing agency. Given that this action appears inconsistent with the requirements set forth in federal regulations, I respectfully request clarification and a formal justification for this decision.*

*Concerns Regarding Procedural Compliance*

*As a probationary employee, I understand that my employing agency has the authority to terminate my appointment based on performance under 5 C.F.R. § 315.804 (see* *[5 C.F.R. § 315.804](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-315/subpart-H/section-315.804%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1740088143867657%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3oAbmfkC1IAd8bPrfelB22&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1740088143889696&usg=AOvVaw1a4VdFSfQP6kmnO6ZE5EL0)**). However, this regulation establishes specific requirements that do not appear to have been fully followed in my case:*

1. *Written Notice Stating Specific Reasons for Termination • 5 C.F.R. § 315.804(a) (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804) states that an agency must provide a probationary employee with “notice in writing as to why the employee is being separated.” The termination notice I received does not contain any specific reasons or evidence supporting the claim of “performance issues.”*
2. *Official Agency Documentation • Per 5 C.F.R. § 315.804(b) (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804), an agency must have documented reasons supporting the termination of a probationary employee. I request copies of any relevant records, including performance evaluations, counseling records, and any prior warnings or notices provided to me.*

*Role of OPM and Agency Responsibility*

*I also seek clarification on whether my termination was initiated solely by my employing agency or if OPM has taken an active role in this decision. According to 5 C.F.R. § 315.804, it is my employing agency’s responsibility—not OPM’s—to take and justify termination actions. If OPM has issued this notice independently, I request an explanation of its authority to do so.*

*Request for Justification and Due Process*

*To ensure my rights are upheld, I respectfully request:*

1. *A clear and specific explanation of the performance deficiencies that led to my termination, as required by 5 C.F.R. § 315.804(a) (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804).*
2. *Copies of any performance evaluations, counseling records, or other documentation used as the basis for my removal, per 5 C.F.R. § 315.804(b) (see 5 C.F.R. § 315.804).*
3. *Confirmation of whether my termination was initiated solely by my employing agency or if OPM played a role in this decision.*
4. *Information on my rights to respond or appeal, including whether I have recourse through the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under 5 C.F.R. § 315.806 (see [5 C.F.R. § 315.806](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-315/subpart-H/section-315.806%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1740088143868621%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3x-CPoyj9jGbT6u0MeBrlK&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1740088143890398&usg=AOvVaw1bTFHxdinfOxkocPyNqu46))*
