# What is a probationary period?

A probationary period is essentially a *trial period for new federal employees*. The length and conditions of probation vary based on the type of federal service:

**Competitive Service:** Competitive service jobs are filled through a merit-based selection process and include most federal positions available to the public. Probationary periods for federal civil servants typically last one year; however, some agencies and positions may require longer periods. For instance, the Department of Defense previously mandated a two-year probationary period for certain positions, but this requirement was repealed effective Dec. 31, 2022, reverting to a one-year probationary period.

**Excepted Service:** These jobs fall outside the competitive hiring process and are typically in agencies with special hiring authorities. Examples include intelligence agencies (e.g., CIA, NSA, FBI), positions in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and some legal positions in the Department of Justice, among others. Hiring for excepted service positions does not follow the standard competitive hiring process but instead allows agencies greater flexibility in selecting candidates. Probationary periods for excepted service positions can last up to two years. Additionally, preference-eligible veterans may qualify for certain benefits, including a shorter probationary period or enhanced appeal rights compared to non-preference eligibles.

**Supervisory or Managerial Positions:** A separate probationary period applies, even for employees with prior service in a non-supervisory role. These positions involve overseeing teams, setting strategic direction, and managing resources within an agency.
