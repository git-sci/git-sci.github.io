# Return to *Office*

{: .no_toc }

*Language note: Calling this return to WORK is an unfair characterization of what telework and remote work is. Return to OFFICE (RTO) is precisely what these orders describe.*

Request a reasonable accommodation if you have any medical limitations. Explore what this may mean. See [Reasonable Accommodation](https://git-sci.github.io/)

If it is impossible for you to comply with the RTO mandate given your circumstances (timing, distance, office limitations, etc) **do not preemptively resign.**  Notify your manager and union of your circumstances and continue to work as normal.

Force your employer to lay you off/terminate you and give a reason. If you are laid off in a RIF you have rights, possible severance pay, and the right to receive unemployment benefits from your state agency. If you are fired you may have a legal case with damages available to you and can have the decision reviewed.  If you resign you forfeit these benefits without a fight. Even when you are uninterested in fighting with your employer it is better to make them take action.

For those retirement eligible, termination has no effect on retirement benefits, at least once those benefits are vested.
