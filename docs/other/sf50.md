The SF-50 is the Notification of Personnel Action. It contains certain employment information useful to the applicant or if applying for another federal job. It is used by current and former federal employees.  It is your written documentation of a personnel action that affects your position or pay.  Keep it with your records because it could be used to make employment, pay, and qualifications decisions about you in the future.  It is your responsibility to read all the information on the front of your SF-50 and notify the Human Resources staff immediately if you notice an error.
