# Speaking Up and Protests

{: .no_toc }

Note:  *Protect yourself and protect others first.  If you feel safe enough in your particular situation to also protest then do so.*  ***It is never without risk.***

## Things to know:

1. **Hatch act:** Federal Employees may ***not*** be candidates for *partisan* public office, use their official position to influence election results, use an official social media account to engage in political activity, engage in political activity in government buildings or while on duty (including using government e-mail systems to distribute political messages or posting on social media), or collect, solicit or receive any financial contributions from the general public through written, oral, email, or social media communications. [Read up on the dos and don’ts here.](https://apwu.org/hatch-act-election)
2. **Strikes:** 5 U.S.C. §7311, specifies that federal employees may not participate in a strike, assert the right to strike, or even belong to a union that “asserts the right to strike against the government of the United States.” Driving the point home, 18 U.S.C. §1918 makes it a felony to strike against the United States or belong to a union that asserts the right to strike against the United States. What’s more, the Office of Personnel Management can declare an individual who participates in a strike unsuitable for federal employment, *permanently*.

## Protest

- Express solidarity with your co-workers.  A lot of unions are asking members to wear flag colors work or other similar actions.  Combating fear and building community with your co-workers is a form of protest.  Nobody should feel alone while we are all being attacked.
- If the administration wants something done they **should request it be done**.  Many of their demands are vague and encourage people to engage in overly-broad protective self-censorship.  Requesting that *actions* be formally requested via proper chains of command and in writing is—in a way—a form of protest. Asking that requests be ***specific*** is—in a way—a form of protest. Perhaps more important immediately—It also creates a formal paper trail.
- **Front office/leadership:** **You have power.** The congressionally approved secretary of your agency has legal power backed by two houses of government. Exercise independence. Modify communications specifying that the law will be followed and that the law respecting collective bargaining agreements will be followed. Ask for waivers, do **all** of the hoops and jumps to get a waiver - even if the denial rate is high.  Culturally right now this could be professionally dangerous for you, but if you are safe you owe it to those who are not to do this work.  You may be doing the leg-work to lay yourself off as part of a RIF. Be clear to yourself about this and ask yourself what you would want someone else to be doing for you, were they in your position.
- Watch union websites for days of action and protests you may want to participate in. Members of unions should organize with their local to visit their congress person’s office for a meeting.
- **Do not gift your labor to the administration**.  In regular times, feds are often known to cut their breaks short, take lunch at their desk, or sometimes stay late to finish up tasks without claiming credit hours or other extended time. In general we shouldn’t be doing this anyway, but especially in these circumstances...
- If you feel safe to do so: when/if you are asked to work extra hours demand **overtime pay only**.  Do **not** do comp time. Likewise, do **not** use credit hours.  When your day is done - put your work down - even if not fully wrapped up.
- Do you communicate with the public?  If you feel safe to do so, when individuals let you know that they are dissatisfied or fearful about your agency’s deteriorating service, point those members of the public to their elected representatives.
- Do not allow work that you were not hired to do to be assigned to you. With staffing shortages there will be enormous pressure for everyone to do 2-3 peoples’ jobs. **As an employee, the staffing shortage is not your job to solve**. You were hired to complete the tasks listed in your performance appraisal. When a manager asks you to work outside of these tasks:
  -  Ask that the work be formally assigned
  - Ask that it be aligned to the duties laid out in the job description you were hired to fill
  -  If a member, of a union ask for union advice when such an ask comes.
