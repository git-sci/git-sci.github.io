## **Do Not:**

- Preemptively resign.
- Preemptively comply.
- Blame yourself.
- Harm yourself.

## Consider avoiding:

- Sharing opinions about the situation at your agency over messengers or in email with co-workers.  Ask co-workers for their personal phone numbers or use other connection methods instead so that you can talk with them that way without crossing lines at work.
- Revealing yourself online when you post, specifically regarding personal opinons or personal matters.
  - There are lots and lots of guides and advice around how to be more private online, but it can be overwhelming and induce paranoia or fear. Too much fear and paranoia prevent us from protecting ourselves and others - even when justified.
  - As ***public*** servants we know that our professional lives are subject to FOIA, our names are often listed on our agency websites, and all of our salaries and names are listed on the web.  And while the public can be scary and sometimes individually dangerous - they are not the threat to the civil workforce.  Keep it basic:
    - Protect yourself and protect others **before** you engage in any form of protest or public criticism - which **always carries risk.  Even if you think you are anonymous you should assume you are not.**
    - Limit how much you share about your personal situation and delete your older post history if it is revealing.
    - Make your social media profiles private. It is probably wise to not post on X/twitter.
    - Donâ€™t share personally identifying information about yourself in open forums (you might consider doing so with journalists you trust under the condition of anonymity).
