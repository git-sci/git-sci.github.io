## Suicide Prevention and Help

Exposure to suicide is a major risk factor for us to experience anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and later potentially develop PTSD. (See: [Cerel et al. 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4716477/)) These deaths impact all of us, because we all can identify our life as being the next at risk and/or can probably name a coworker whose safety we fear for. No matter how the media portrays this - it’s workplace stress, and now workplace violence. Below are a set of resources for helping different people through these times.
