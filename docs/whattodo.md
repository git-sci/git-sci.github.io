# If you are terminated

## ***Are you sure you were fired?***

Unless you work for OPM, **OPM does not have the authority to fire you.**  Only your own agency can do that. Verify with your supervisor and their supervisor that you were actually fired. Ask for a reason from them in writing! **See** **[Templates and Records Practice](https://git-sci.github.io/)** **for example emails!**

- *Non-probationary employees*: you have a right to advance notice with specific charges and a chance to respond. If you actually get a notice of proposed removal, then seek competent legal advice
- *Probationary* *employees*: the situation is a bit different, but probationary employees still have rights! See [What is a probationary period](https://git-sci.github.io/) and this document



If you want to appeal remember: **you generally have only 30 days to file and appeal**

## Quick Start: What to Do First – FAQ for Fired Federal Employees

If you've been fired from a federal job, here's what you need to do right now. This section gives you quick answers to the most urgent questions you might have.

1. **Can I still get paid?**

✔ Yes, you can apply for unemployment benefits even if you don’t have your SF-50. File immediately. If you don’t have all records, submit what you can.

✔ TSP (Thrift Savings Plan) – You can roll over, withdraw, or leave your funds in your account.

✔ Unused leave payout – Request payout for any unused leave if eligible.

📌 File for unemployment now: 👉 [careeronestop.org](http://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits) (see [Unemployment](https://git-sci.github.io/))

**2. How do I get my personnel & pay records?**

✔ Request your Official Personnel Folder (OPF) from the National Personnel Records Center if your agency refuses to provide it. Check out [Virtual Bags](https://git-sci.github.io/)

✔ Pay records – Request your W-2s, pay stubs, or other pay records from your agency or payroll provider. Check out [Virtual Bags](https://git-sci.github.io/)

📌 Request records from NPRC: 👉 [www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center](http://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center)

**3. Can I file an appeal if I was wrongfully fired?**

✔ Yes. You have 30 days to file an appeal with the MSPB (Merit Systems Protection Board). If you believe discrimination or retaliation was involved, you can file with the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) or OSC (Office of Special Counsel). Check out [Appeal Information](https://git-sci.github.io/)

📌 File an appeal with MSPB: 👉 [www.mspb.gov](http://www.mspb.gov/)

**4. How do I get health insurance?**

✔ You can ask for a **free** 31 day extension to your health insurance. During this time, employees can work with their health insurer to convert their insurance plan into self-funded coverage – they should contact their insurer for assistance [OPM guidance](https://www.opm.gov/frequently-asked-questions/insure-faq/health/as-a-former-employee-am-i-eligible-for-a-31-day-extension-of-coverage/)

✔ ACA Marketplace plans – You may be eligible for subsidized health plans through the Affordable Care Act.

✔ Medicaid – If your income has dropped significantly, you may qualify for state Medicaid coverage.  Check out [Financial](https://git-sci.github.io/)

✔ COBRA/TCC – You may qualify to continue your federal health insurance coverage temporarily but at your own cost | Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) is the Federal analog to COBRA — like only take this route for emergencies or you have a difficult to manage health condition where changing insurance would be a huge negative factor. If something happens medically to you or your family in the next 60 days you can RETROACTIVELY opt-in to it. You do not need to immediately opt in. It will be an expensive option since you’re now responsible for the full premium whereas before separating the government was subsidizing a good proportion of your FEHB. Details [here](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/temporary-continuation-of-coverage/#url=Pamphlet)

✔ Employees can opt to be added to spouse’s federal health plan, because loss of employment qualifies as a major life event and allows enrollment outside of Open Season.

📌 Find health insurance options: 👉 [www.healthcare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov/)

**5. Can I get therapy or mental health support?**

✔ Yes. Many federal agencies have Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) which may still be available temporarily after separation. Check out [EAP](https://git-sci.github.io/)

✔ You can also access free or low-cost therapy services through NAMI, MHA, and community health centers.

📌 Find mental health resources: 👉 [www.nami.org](http://www.nami.org/)

**6. What happens to my retirement benefits?**

✔ If you were under FERS, you may qualify for deferred retirement or disability retirement.

✔ If you have less than 5 years of service, FERS (aka pension) contributions can be withdrawn since you don’t qualify for a pension. Suppose you are a GS 7 with ~1 year of service, your payout will be about $2500; ~3 years would be about $7500. Your paystubs should show you how much you've contributed. [OPM Guidance](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-center/fers-information/former-employees/)

✔ TSP – You can leave your savings in your account or transfer it to an IRA.

    - If you are laid off while undergoing a subsequent probationary period but have at least 5 years of service, your FERS contributions can be a large chunk of change (especially if you were contributing 4.4% under FERS-FRAE!). You can withdraw it as cash or reinvest it in an IRA. If you take another federal job in the future, you can pay back into FERS (with interest equivalent to the G-fund) to get back into the pension program. [OPM Guidance](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-center/fers-information/former-employees/)
    - If you are 55 or above, you have access to the "Rule of 55" You can withdraw from your TSP without the 10% **tax-penalty** . You will still need to pay any federal or state taxes for withdrawing from your traditional TSP. [Detailed blog post](https://www.federalpensionadvisors.com/post/tsp-rule-of-55)

📌 Check your FERS retirement options: 👉 [www.opm.gov/retirement-services](http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services)

**7. What’s next? Do I look for another federal job or go private sector?**

✔ Both options are valid. You may qualify for federal job preferences if you were terminated under certain conditions. Alternatively, private-sector jobs or contractor roles may be available.

## Fired Federal Employee Survival Guide



1. **File for Unemployment NOW**

Don’t wait for your SF-50 or SF-8. File anyway. Check out [Virtual Bags](https://git-sci.github.io/)

State unemployment offices may not have your federal pay records. Send what you have:

- Pay stubs (last 6 quarters if possible)
- W-2s from your agency
- Separation notice or termination letter

If you don’t have proof of 6 quarters of pay, *FILE ANYWAY*. You can request records and provide them later.

📌 Find your state’s unemployment website: 👉 [www.careeronestop.org](http://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits)

**2. Get Your Personnel & Pay Records (If You Can)**

📌 File online with OWCP: [www.ecomp.dol.gov](http://www.ecomp.dol.gov/)

Federal standard is different from state workers' comp rules. OWCP only requires proof that work contributed to or worsened your condition. It does NOT have to be the main cause.

## Bankruptcy Info – If You’re Struggling with Debt

If you're facing financial hardship after losing your job, filing for bankruptcy may be a way to relieve overwhelming debt. Here are some things to consider:

1. **Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy**

✔ Chapter 7 – Liquidation of non-exempt assets to pay off debt. This option discharges most debts but can affect property ownership.
✔ Chapter 13 – Reorganization of debt. You repay a portion of your debt over 3–5 years, and some debts may be forgiven.

**2. When Should You File for Bankruptcy?**

✔ If you're unable to make minimum monthly payments and are struggling to pay basic expenses.
✔ If your credit score is severely impacted and you can’t see a way out of debt.

**3. Bankruptcy Process**

✔ File with a bankruptcy court to begin the process. You’ll need to provide a detailed list of your debts, assets, and income.
✔ Consult with a bankruptcy attorney who can help you decide if this is the right option for you. Many offer free consultations.

## Contacting Your Supervisor and Others for Support

1. **Contact Your Supervisor (or Past Supervisors)**

Supervisors are often crucial to your employment history and may be a source of valuable references or documentation. If you are unable to get records or references directly from your agency, reach out to past supervisors or managers to get a reference for your time there. Ask for support in gathering records like performance reviews, awards, or any documentation that could help your case for appeals or job search.

**2. Gather Personal Contact Information**

If possible, try to obtain personal contact details for supervisors or colleagues who could serve as references or provide useful information related to your employment. In case you need to reach them in the future (if records from the agency are incomplete), having their contact information could be vital.

**3. Contact Colleagues or Others Who Can Help**

Peers and coworkers may have insights into your performance, work ethic, or other relevant experiences during your time working. They might also be able to provide documentation or vouch for your character and contributions to the organization.
