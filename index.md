# Resources 

As things evolve for the federal workforce and in scientific workplaces, this is a set of resources compiled from various locations across the web. 

There is no affiliation with or endorsement of any programs or resources in this post. This is not financial, medical, or legal advice. This is a bank of resource information.

### Know the difference between all the programs that you may be offered down the road if you think your agency will be further downsized:

- VERA (Voluntary Early Retirement Authority) allows you to use your retirement benefits early if you meet certain age and/or time in service requirements. [VERA OPM Webpage](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/voluntary-early-retirement-authority/); [Video about VERA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5rYQV9vtvE)
- VSIP (Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment Authority) allows agencies that are downsizing or restructuring to offer employees lump-sum payments up to $25,000 as an incentive to voluntarily separate. It is often used in conjunction with VERA as a buyout offer for people not eligible for VERA.

- Severance Pay is for full-time and part-time employees who are involuntarily separated from Federal service and meet other conditions of eligibility. It looks like most of the recent firings of probational employees are not considered to meet the eligibility requirements.
